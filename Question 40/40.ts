// Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. The function
// should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these
// two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
// albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly.
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an
// album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the
// albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an
// album.
